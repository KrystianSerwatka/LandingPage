# Landing Page

This is a landing page with a form using PHP.

## Why I created a Landing Page?

In 2021, I wanted to expand into programming. At the company I work at, there was an opportunity to move to a different department, or rather talks in that direction. After a few conversations I was given the task to make a simple landing page using bootstrap library and a form using PHP. Before this project I was mainly focused on the front-end. At that moment I was taking my first steps in PHP. Of course, on the front-end I had no problems making a sample page without focusing on the aesthetics of the site. However, on the back-end side there were immediately problems, which I will write in the following sections.

## What have I learned in this project?

In this project, I primarily learned how to look at website making from a back-end perspective. Below I will write out exactly what I learned on the front-end and back-end side.

**Front-end**
- Using as many bootstrap classes as possible in terms of replacing CSS e.g. top margin etc.

- Improving knowledge on responsiveness and making structure of website in HTML


**Back-end**
- What is the difference between POST and GET method

- How to connect to the database through a web page

- Connecting to a database using PDO

- Separating and merging PHP files

- Implementation of PHP code and files inside the HTML code(for example using $_SESSION)

- Sending data to a database using a form(using SQL)

- Extracting and comparing individual records and columns from the database and operating on them

- Validation of form fields (empty fields and unwanted content)

- Protection in form fields against unwanted values like: double space, database hacking etc.

- Use and handling of cookies

- Anti-spam in the form for 5min

- Sending an email to my mailbox

**Others**
- A basic SEO addition to the site

- Correct folder structure and location of files

## What made me most of the problems?

In short - all the elements mentioned above related to the back-end. Because of the fact it was my first project from the back-end combined with the front-end.

## A few words from me

This was my first project using PHP on a website. I learned a lot in terms of security on the site. I probably won't be returning to projects focused on PHP. It was a very valuable project for me and I think that thanks to it I made a very big step although at the moment I want to follow the path of a front-end developer. I recommend everyone to do at least one project using back-end because such experience will be very useful and in the future you will have contact with it what will allow you to extend your horizons.

I'm sorry about my English not very good. I'm trying to improve my level overnight, I used -> [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to translate most of it.
